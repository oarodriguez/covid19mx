# covid19mx

A project to analyze the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.

## Installation of dependencies

Dependencies are managed by [poetry], so poetry should be installed in the system. In the project
root directory, execute

```shell
poetry install
```

Poetry will take care of the installation process. Afterward, the project packages and command-line
interface tools should be available in the current shell. It is recommended to create a separate
virtual environment for this project.
